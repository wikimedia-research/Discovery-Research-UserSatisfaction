## Initial schema

\center

![](../T105355_validation/notebook_files/figure-html/bias_check-1.png)

Strict JavaScript requirements in __[v1](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Schema:TestSearchSatisfaction)__ biased sampling.

## Revised schema

![](../T111260_validation/figures/second_ua_data.png)

Logged nearly 300,000 events from 10,211 sessions with __[v2](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Schema:TestSearchSatisfaction2)__.

## Results

![Kaplan-Meier curve of time spent on page.](figures/survival.png)

The first quarter of users closed the page within the first 25s, and after a minute, we have lost 1/2 of our users.

----

![Fraction of users remaining as a function of time spent on page, statified by OS.](figures/survival_os.png)

A greater fraction of Linux users kept the pages open for at least 420s than users on any other OS.

----

![Fraction of users remaining as a function of time spent on page, statified by OS after lumping Windows versions.](figures/survival_os2.png)

Combined the fragmented Windows sub-populations into a single Windows group.

* Retained a greater fraction of Linux and Ubuntu users past 400s.
* Lost Android and iOS users faster than on other platforms.

----

![Fraction of users remaining as a function of time spent on page, statified by browser.](figures/survival_browser.png)

* Users across the various browsers behaved similarly.
* The big exception is Safari users (pink), who we lose the fastest.

----

![Fraction of users remaining as a function of time spent on page, statified by language.](figures/survival_lang.png)

Users remained on German and Russian wiki pages longer than on wikis in other languages.

----

![Fraction of users remaining as a function of time spent on page, statified by project.](figures/survival_proj.png)

* Lost users the fastest on Commons (red). By 40s, we have already lost half those users.
* Users viewing Wikiquote (blue) pages stayed on those pages longer than users on others. Didn't lose half users until 120s!

----

![Fraction of users remaining as a function of time spent on page, statified by wiki.](figures/survival_wiki.png)

* Users of Russian and German Wikipedias stayed on those pages longer.
* Spanish and English Wikipedias (along with other wikis) very similar.

## Discussion

Already a valid schema that yields useful data.

Proposed improvements:

  * Log scroll events
    * Ping server if user has scrolled in the last 30-60s.
    * Can be used later to make check-ins more robust.
  * Record additional data for events already in schema:
    1. Number of results returned to user.
    2. Ranking of visited page as it was on SERP.

## Thank you!
